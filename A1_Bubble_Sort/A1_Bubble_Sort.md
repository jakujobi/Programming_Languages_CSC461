### Assignment Instructions:
**Objective:**  
Create a complete pseudo-code program to perform the following tasks using the PseudoCode language developed in class, with **Absolute Addressing**.

---
### Deliverables:
1. Submit your source code in a file named `A1.dat`.  
   You should include the input cards shown below in the program as a test.

---
### The Program:

1. **Input**:  
   First, read a value **N** (range of 5-500), which indicates the number of values to be read and sorted in ascending order.  
   (If **N** is 20, there will be 20 more cards to read).
2. **Array Setup**:  
   Read the values into an array.
3. **Bubble Sort Algorithm**:  
   Sort the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm. You are required to use the modified version of Bubble Sort provided below (which uses bottom-tested loops, as supported by the class language using the `Incr` & `Test` construct).

```pseudocode
    int i; 
    int j; 
    int t; 

    i = 0; 
    do                           
    { 
        j = 0;  
        do 
        { 
            if (A[j] > A[j+1]) 
            { 
                t = A[j]; 
                A[j] = A[j+1]; 
                A[j+1] = t; 
            }    
            j++;         
        } while(j < N-1);           

        i++; 
    } while(i < N-1); 
```

4. **Output 1**:  
   After sorting the values, print them out in ascending order.

5. **Output 2**:  
   Finally, print the values that lie between **50 and 150 (inclusive)** in ascending order.

---
### Input Cards:

You should use the following input cards for your test and include them in your file:

```
10  
94  
150  
113  
37  
63  
160  
128  
235  
117  
1
```

```yaml
+0000000010   // N = 10
+0000000094   // First value
+0000000150   // Second value
+0000000113   // Third value
+0000000037   // Fourth value
+0000000063   // Fifth value
+0000000160   // Sixth value
+0000000128   // Seventh value
+0000000235   // Eighth value
+0000000117   // Ninth value
+0000000001   // Tenth value
```

---

### Expected Output:
1. **Sorted Values**:  
   ```
   1  
   37  
   63  
   94  
   113  
   117  
   128  
   150  
   160  
   235
   ```

2. **Values Between 50 and 150**:  
   ```
   63  
   94  
   113  
   117  
   128  
   150
   ```

Define the variables
- First Loop start
- Assign j to 0
- second loop start
- If aj larger start
- check if j'th item in array A is larger than (j+1)th item in Array A
- if it is larger , then jump to swap
- Swap start
	- move jth item to temporary spot
	- move (j+1)th item to jth spot
	- move temp to (j+1)spot

Program start
- make a place for i
- make a place for j
- make a place for t
- place 0 into i
- read N and store
	- Loop for going through array
	-
